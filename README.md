`mzR` is a
[Bioconductor package](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/mzR.html)
that provides a unified API to the common file formats and parsers
available for mass spectrometry data. It comes with a wrapper for the
ISB random access parser for mass spectrometry mzXML, mzData and mzML
files. The package contains the original code written by the ISB, and
a subset of the proteowizard library for mzML and mzIdentML. The
netCDF reading code has previously been used in XCMS.
